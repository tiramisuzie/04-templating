// COMMENT: Why are there parentheses around "(a,b)" in the .sort() method, but not around the "articleObject" or "article" arguments in the .forEach() methods?
// The reason there are parentheses around (a,b) is because there is more than one parameter being passed. articleObject is one parameter so it does not need the parentheses but they can be added if you like.

  return (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn));
